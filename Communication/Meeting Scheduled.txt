# Meeting Scheduled

Your supervisor wanted to meet with you at 3 pm (over Zoom) to go over a few items. It’s 3:05 pm now but your supervisor hasn’t shown up yet. It’s now 3:15 pm now and your supervisor still hasn’t shown up yet. You log off from Zoom and continue with your work.

Please answer the following questions:

1. What went wrong here?
	1. My supervisor probably got caught in other works requiring their attention and I should've notified them after the meeting time has passed.
2. If you were super proactive in your communication, what would you have done? What message would you send your supervisor and when would you send this?
	1. I would notify my supervisor at 3:00 pm. I will ask them to follow up with an email and I would let them decide if they want to reschedule a meeting if they couldn't come or just send me a list of the things they want to go over.

Draft the communications you would send to your supervisor and when you would send each of these communications.

To {supervisor},
From Joshuel Ernest Q. Simbulan,

Good day, {supervisor}. I would like to notify you that we have a meeting regarding some of the details that you want me to be aware of. I understand that you might not be able to attend our meeting. If possible, may I know if we're going to reschedule at a later date? Much appreciated. Thank you.
