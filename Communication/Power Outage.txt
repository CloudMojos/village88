1. What communication would you send out to your project manager/supervisor? Would you send this after the power comes back or would you send this communication before the power comes back? How many hours after the power outage would you send this email?
		- It seems like I can still do the work on Saturday and Sunday, so there would be no need to notify my project manager or supervisor if I can do the work anyway.
		- I wouldn't use the sick leave on Monday if I don't have to, but if I am feeling really sick, and if I have good relationship with my supervisor and if it's possible, I would ask if I could continue working from home so that I wouldn't have to commute. 

2. Say you were mentoring someone else in the Village and this person failed to send any type of communication back to the supervisor/team till Monday morning. What advice would you give this person?
	- I'd start with empathizing, maybe he/she has things going on in his/her life, but I'd also tell him/her that he/she should at least communicate better so that our work, the thing that gives us our daily bread, will continue providing for us. 
	- I'd ask them to create a schedule or reminders so that he/she could see some sort of overview of what should happen during those days, weeks, or months.
	
3. How would you make up for the lack of progress and the lack of hours you’ve put into the project? How would you communicate this to the supervisor? Or would you just assume that it’s okay not to make up for these hours as it’s already Saturday your time?
	- This is type C person in the lessons. The only real way I could keep my job is to make time, do the work, and deliver. 

4. If you missed any important deadlines for the project due to this, how would you make up to your supervisor/team for this lack of progress? How would you communicate this?
	- I will apologize. I will let them know that I am spending time with the project and not just lazing around. I will tell them the points where I get stuck in the project and maybe ask for advice and/or support on how I could overcome them.
