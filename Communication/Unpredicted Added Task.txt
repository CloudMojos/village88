- How will you communicate this with your team?
  If I were in this situation, I would communicate with my team as soon as possible about the task that requires RnD. I would let them know that I have encountered a task that I did not anticipate and that it may affect the timeline of the project. I would also let them know that I am working on the task and will keep them updated on my progress. 
- After the RnD, you found out it will take at least another day to finish the task. How will you say it to your team and your supervisor?
  After the RnD, if I found out that it will take at least another day to finish the task, I would inform my team and supervisor immediately. I would let them know that I have completed the RnD and that it will take an additional day to finish the task. I would also let them know that I am doing everything I can to complete the task as soon as possible.
- If you are a team leader, what would be your response to this kind of situation?
  If I were a team leader, I would encourage my team to communicate with me as soon as possible if they encounter any issues or obstacles that may affect the timeline of the project. I would also work with them to find a solution that will help us meet our deadline. It is important to remember that unexpected issues can arise during a project, and it is our responsibility to work together to overcome them.
- What do you think is the possible solution to make it to your deadline?
  One possible solution to make it to the deadline is to prioritize the remaining tasks based on their importance and urgency. This will help ensure that the most critical tasks are completed first, and that we are making the most efficient use of our time. It may also be helpful to delegate some tasks to other team members if possible, to help lighten the workload.
