Your wife suddenly feels sick. She could not stand up due to a headache and dizziness. She needs to lie down and needs assistance when going to the bathroom or when eating. You have just finished a meeting and a task needs to be completed within the day.

- What would be your plan in this situation?
	My wife is very important to me (I mean in the future, when I actually have a wife), but so is my work. I will try my best to sit down in front of the computer and finish the task while also taking breaks and helping my wife. 
- What would you do if helping your wife means you won't be able to complete all the tasks for the day?
	  Then I will have to ask my supervisors to extend the deadline for the task (if my relationship with them is still good) and I will work overtime.
- How should you communicate this with your supervisor and with your teammates?
	  I will tell them that I will have to take care of my wife so I wouldn't be able to communicate as often (I will be busy finishing my part of the project). But I will also keep them updated via whatever our medium of project management is so that the team will stay coherent and operating.
