Dear {Client},
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you of a recent issue that has come to my attention regarding the project. Unfortunately, we have lost all user data for the last four weeks. I understand that this is a significant setback for the project, and I take full responsibility for the situation.

I suspect that our website may have been hacked, causing these errors. I admit that I could have done things better on my end to handle these types of scenarios, but I was busy maintaining the other part of the project. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

I would like to schedule a meeting with you as soon as possible to discuss the situation further. I believe that we can work together to find a solution that will meet your needs and expectations. Please let me know if you are available to meet in the next few days.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards, Joshuel Ernest Simbulan
