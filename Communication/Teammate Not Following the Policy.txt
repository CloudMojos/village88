Mimi is new to the company. She is very excited to be involved in new projects and to learn from her teammates. She reads the company policy provided by HR, but she noticed that Matt, a tenured teammate is not following the policy. Matt always goes out during work hours in the afternoon and would return after 1-3 hours. Her Mimi got confused because she read in the policy that an employee is only allowed at most 30 minutes of break in the afternoon. She asked Matt where he was going and Matt told her he normally meets his friends. Matt also told Mimi that it's okay and he just needs to offset the missed hours in the evening. Their supervisor is working remotely and he is busy managing other employees.

- What is wrong with this situation?
  Matt is blatantly going against the company policy provided by HR
- What should Mimi do?
  Tell the HR.
- To whom and how should Mimi communicate this?
  To Human Resources. Explain the situation and I wouldn't name call immediately. I will have them look for the person themselves. This is their job.
