Steve woke up feeling very down. He does not have an appetite to eat breakfast nor he doesn't want to go to work. He feels there's no sense in going to work or even doing anything else. He just wants to sleep the whole day. He has been feeling this for the past 3 days. Steve tried to report for work and do the tasks assigned to him, but he seems to get things wrong. The quality of his work is not the same as it used to be.

- What do you think is happening here?
  Personally, I wouldn't know. Steve probably has lost a loved one, maybe physically sick or just feeling [lost]([Quarter-life crisis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-life_crisis)). The best thing to do is ask.
- If you were Steve's supervisor and you noticed the change in Steve's output after 3 days, what would you do?
  If I were Steveâ€™s supervisor and I noticed the change in his output after 3 days, I would schedule a meeting with him to discuss his recent behavior and performance. During the meeting, I would ask him if there is anything going on in his personal life that may be affecting his work. If there is, then I will ask him to have a vacation for 2 days, ask him to seek professional help. I wouldn't hint that he could get fired if he still doesn't get better immediately as it could be counterproductive, but I will tell him after the vacation and after he got professional medical check up.
- If you were Steve, how are you going to communicate this to your supervisor and teammates?
  If I were Steve, I would communicate my situation to my supervisor and teammates by scheduling a meeting with them. During the meeting, I would explain how I have been feeling and how it has been affecting my work. I would also let them know that I am seeking help and support to get through this difficult time.
