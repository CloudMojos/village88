To {Client},
 Good day! I am Mark from Village 88. Is it possible to meet you anytime soon so that we can go over the details of the project? While waiting for you reply, I believe it is also beneficial that I give you an overview of my concern as the developer of the things that I want to talk about. It would be beneficial for the project's development if we can set a clear specification for this project. Furthermore, it would be fruitious if we can create an expectation of work to be done each day. I will be making a draft of the project timeline and I would like to hear your response about it in the meeting. Thank you.
